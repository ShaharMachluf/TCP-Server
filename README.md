# TCP-Server
## About
This project was about creating a tcp server that gets a http request and send a http response containing a ok message and the html file.

## How to Run
First, run the tcp_server.py file. Then open a web browser.  
If you run the server and the browser from the same computer write the URL: http://127.0.0.1:80/HelloWorld.html  
If you run it from a different computer write the URL: http://<the ip of the computer that runs the server>:80/HelloWorld.html
